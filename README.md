# OpenClaw Evals Framework

## Project Purpose

OpenClaw Evals is an agent evaluation framework specifically designed for OpenClaw, providing systematic ways to measure, track, and improve AI agent performance. The framework focuses on key metrics including cost tracking, performance benchmarking, and automated evaluation pipelines.

## Current Status

This project is currently in the initialization phase. We're establishing the foundational components including cost tracking mechanisms, basic evaluation infrastructure, and initial benchmarking capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

The framework consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Cost Tracking Module**: Monitors and aggregates usage costs across different providers (OpenRouter, etc.)
2. **Evaluation Engine**: Runs benchmarks and performance tests against agent implementations
3. **Reporting System**: Generates dashboards and analytics for performance insights
4. **Automation Layer**: Enables continuous integration and regression testing
5. **Multi-Agent Support**: Facilitates comparison and coordination between different agent configurations

## How to Use

Detailed usage instructions will be added as components are developed. Currently, the framework is being built out and not yet ready for general use.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to the OpenClaw Evals framework:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Please ensure your code follows the existing style and includes appropriate tests.
